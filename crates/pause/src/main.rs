//! Anchor process holding a guest PID namespace open.
//!
//! A Linux PID namespace has no content of its own: the kernel destroys it,
//! killing everything inside, the moment its PID 1 exits, and no new process
//! can be created in it afterwards. Unlike a network or IPC namespace it
//! therefore cannot be kept alive by a bind mount, and since
//! `unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)` does not move the caller into the new namespace —
//! only the caller's next child becomes its PID 1 — a thread cannot stand in
//! either. Something has to be PID 1 and stay there, which is all this
//! program does.
//!
//! It is spawned by the guest's NamespaceManager (see
//! `internal/vminit/namespaces`) with `CLONE_NEWPID`, and lives until that
//! service kills it to tear the namespace down.
//!
//! This is `no_std` deliberately. The whole program is three signal
//! dispositions and a sleep, none of which needs anything from `std`, and
//! avoiding it keeps the binary small enough that exec'ing it costs
//! essentially nothing.
